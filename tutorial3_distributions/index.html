    <h1>Gamestop Reddit Post Comments vs. Upvotes</h1>
    <p>This scatterplot displays number of comments vs
      upvotes for Reddit posts about Gamestop stock. 
      The data source can be found here: 
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yorkehead/stock-market-subreddits">
        on Kaggle (Stock Market Subreddits</a>. 
     </p>

    <p>The posts are categorized by three Subreddits:
      <ol>
        <li>Investing</li>
        <li>Stocks</li>
        <li>Wallstreet Bets</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>I think it's interesting how many more upvotes
      and posts happen on Wallstreet Bets vs. the other
      categories.
    </p>
    <p>One enhancement comes to mind: trimming the outliers
      and see if there's a better linear shape to the data
      based on shortening the x-axis that way.
